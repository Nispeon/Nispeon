# Yo 😎 

Welcome aboard! The name's Julien, or Nispeon if you want to be chums like that, and this is my GitHub page ✨

## Who am I ?

A student in web development first of all, in my (almost) third year of college at the [IIM Digital School](https://www.iim.fr)💻

I'm working on getting a web project management diploma, but I'm most interested in back-end developping (mainly in PHP and its frameworks).

But enough with the text, let's make this look better:

- 👯 Fun to hang with (biased opinion) but very shy at first
- 🍃 Not very knowledgeable yet but eager to learn
- 🐱 Random cat emoji
- 🌱 Learning more about PHP everyday, I'm kinda making it my main thing
- ⚙ Just released a [big Symfony project](https://github.com/pgrimaud/git-stars) with [@pgrimaud](https://github.com/pgrimaud)
- 📍 Current objective : Getting as much experience as possible and conquering the world with PHP
- 🎉 Now working at @jolicode

..
Oh and I'm based in Paris, I figured I should point it out with this being written in english and all 👃


## What can I do ?

Well not that much yet, but hold on! 

I've been seeing tons of stuff which I've more or less grasped recently, and I know a lot of things, look:

### What I've learned the basics of at school:

And a lot about project management, but this is another topic.
Also I know Filezilla, just thought I'd mention it.

### Stuff I've seen more of outside of school:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120557894-e53cab00-c3fe-11eb-8fbb-23e5d85414f0.png" alt="Javascript" align="left" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558029-203ede80-c3ff-11eb-96f0-586f1b452063.png" alt="Shopify" align="left" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120556978-89bded80-c3fd-11eb-812e-8868f1213ceb.png" alt="Adobe XD" align="left" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120559211-ecfd4f00-c400-11eb-8f88-38c2c914e817.png" alt="MySQL" style="margin:10px" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/133062027-7a227ba2-3575-4b33-98e7-318fe4fc3aeb.png" alt="Docker" style="margin:10px" height="50">

I've seen most of these at school too, but I've been using 'em outside of it for private projects so I've got more than the basics.

### The things I'm the best at 😎:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558538-e91cfd00-c3ff-11eb-9eff-b00f4281ef68.jpg" alt="Symfony" align="left" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558576-f89c4600-c3ff-11eb-918d-30e2ab27bd01.png" alt="Laravel" align="left" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558940-7bbd9c00-c400-11eb-9d86-5bc7d30b622a.png" alt="Adobe XD" height="50">

Oh and of course I have no problem with HTML & CSS but that's barely worth mentioning.

But basically that's the stuff you should hire me for.
