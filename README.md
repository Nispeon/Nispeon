# Yo 😎 

Welcome aboard! The name's Julien, or Nispeon if you want to be friends, and this is my GitHub page ✨

## Who am I ?

A student in web developpement first of all, in my (almost) third year of college at the [IIM Digital School](https://www.iim.fr)💻

I'm working on getting a web project management diploma, but I'm most interested in back-end developping (mainly in PHP and its frameworks).

But enough with the text, let's make this look better:

- 👯 Fun to hang with (biased opinion) but shy
- 🍃 Not very knowledgeable yet but eager to learn
- 🐱 Random cat emoji
- 🌱 Learning more about PHP everyday, I'm kinda making it my main thing
- ⚙ Currently working on a big Symfony project with [@pgrimaud](https://github.com/pgrimaud)
- 📍 Current objective : Getting an internship for my 3rd year of college by September 2021 to get some hands-on experience in programming

..
Oh and I'm based in Paris, I figured I should point it out with this being written in english and all 👃


## What can I do ?

Well not so much yet, but hold on! 

I've been seeing tons of stuff which I've more or less grasped recently, and I know tons of stuff, look:

### What I've learned the basics of at school:

And a lot about project management, but this is another topic.

### Stuff I've seen more of outside of school:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120557894-e53cab00-c3fe-11eb-8fbb-23e5d85414f0.png" alt="Javascript" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558029-203ede80-c3ff-11eb-96f0-586f1b452063.png" alt="Shopify" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120556978-89bded80-c3fd-11eb-812e-8868f1213ceb.png" alt="Adobe XD" style="margin:10px" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120559211-ecfd4f00-c400-11eb-8f88-38c2c914e817.png" alt="MySQL" style="margin:10px" height="50">

I mean, I've seen JS at school too, but I've been using it outside of it for private projects.

### The things I'm the best at 😎:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558538-e91cfd00-c3ff-11eb-9eff-b00f4281ef68.jpg" alt="Symfony" style="margin:10px" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558576-f89c4600-c3ff-11eb-918d-30e2ab27bd01.png" alt="Laravel" style="margin:10px" height="50"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37938250/120558940-7bbd9c00-c400-11eb-9d86-5bc7d30b622a.png" alt="Adobe XD" style="margin:10px" height="50">

Oh and of course I have no problem with HTML & CSS but that's barely worth mentioning.

But basically that's the stuff you should hire me for.


## My projects

- May 2021: 

[LaMetric - Stocks](https://github.com/pgrimaud/lametric-stocks): App to follow stock prices on an LaMetric connected clock

[LaMetric - Bitpanda](https://github.com/pgrimaud/lametric-bitpanda): App to follow your Bitpanda wallets on an LaMetric connected clock 

..
Well for now I don't have much in public, most of my stuff was either for school or just not good enough. 

But I'll add the links here when the time comes, and it'll be pinned on my page anyways.
